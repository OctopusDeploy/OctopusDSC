# cOctopusServer

## Sample

First, ensure the OctopusDSC module is on your `$env:PSModulePath`. Then you can create and apply configuration like this.

```PowerShell
Configuration SampleConfig
{
    Import-DscResource -Module OctopusDSC

    Node "localhost"
    {
        cOctopusServer OctopusServer
        {
            Ensure = "Present"
            State = "Started"

            # Server instance name. Leave it as 'OctopusServer' unless you have more
            # than one instance
            Name = "OctopusServer"

            # The url that Octopus will listen on
            WebListenPrefix = "http://localhost:81"

            SqlDbConnectionString = "Server=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;Database=Octopus;Trusted_Connection=True;"

            # The admin user to create
            OctopusAdminCredential = $PSCredentialObject

            # optional parameters
            AllowUpgradeCheck = $true
            AllowCollectionOfAnonymousUsageStatistics = $true
            ForceSSL = $false
            ListenPort = 10943
            DownloadUrl = "https://octopus.com/downloads/latest/WindowsX64/OctopusServer"

            # for pre 3.5, valid values are "UsernamePassword"
            # for 3.5 and above, only "Ignore" is valid (this is the default value)
            LegacyWebAuthenticationMode = "UsernamePassword"

            HomeDirectory = "C:\Octopus"

            # if not supplied, Octopus will use a free license
            LicenseKey = "base64encodedlicense"
        }
    }
}

SampleConfig

Start-DscConfiguration .\SampleConfig -Verbose -wait

Test-DscConfiguration
```

## Settings

When `Ensure` is set to `Present`, the resource will:

 1. Download the Octopus Server MSI from the internet
 2. Install the MSI
 3. Create the database
 4. Set the admin username and password
 5. Configure with a free licence
 6. Start the service

When `Ensure` is set to `Absent`, the resource will:

 1. Delete the Octopus Server windows service
 2. Uninstall using the MSI if there are no other instances installed on this machine

When `State` is `Started`, the resource will ensure that the Octopus Servr windows service is running. When `Stopped`, it will ensure the service is stopped.

## Drift

This means that the server will be automatically reconfigured if you change any properties except the ones listed above.

If the DownloadUrl property changes, it will detect the configuration drift and upgrade the Server as appropriate. However, if you leave it as default (ie 'install latest'), it will not upgrade when a new version is released - it only actions on change of the property.

However if you need to change any of the `SqlDbConnectionString`, `OctopusAdminCredential` properties, you will need to uninstall then reinstall the server (by changing `Ensure` to `Absent` and then back to `Present`).
