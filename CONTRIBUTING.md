# How to Contribute
Thank you for going to the effort of contributing some code.

If you've found a bug or something isn't working, please quickly check the issues in
our [main issue repository](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues).

If your change is small or you have already made the change, please go ahead and submit a pull request.

For other changes, please raise an issue first to check that the change aligns with our plan for the product. We ask this to avoid disappointment and wasted effort if it does not.

If your pull request or proposed change is for a bug that is causing problems for you, please also [contact support](http://octopusdeploy.com/support) referencing your pull request to make sure it gets prioritized properly. They may also be able to find a work around in the meantime.

If you have an idea or a feature request, please post it to [our UserVoice site](http://octopusdeploy.uservoice.com) so others can vote for it.

If you're a keen contributor, a regular OctopusDSC user or just curious, please feel free to join us in the `#octopusdsc` channel at our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/octopususergroup/shared_invite/enQtNDcyNjM3OTczNzAxLTU0MjI3YmIyMDc1MzdmYjk3OTYzZGY4ZTI2NTcwMzY3OGJkZTExYTVkNThjYjM1MWE2YjlmNWQyMmQwNzRmMjk)
